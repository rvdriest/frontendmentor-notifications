## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links
- Live Site URL: [Notifications](https://frontendmentor-notifications.vercel.app/)

## My Process

### Built with

- Vue 3 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Pinia
- Typescript

### What I learned

This is the first time i've properly used vue 3. Really enjoy using it. Also first time using Pinia. I am used to using vuex so Pinia was new to me. I really like that it is typed!

### Continued development

The notification types can definitely be improved. Particularly the 'data' type of the notification. This should change depending on the notification type. Currently the type is just any which means there is no type completion on this part.
